In this homework, you are going to add sound files and effects to your program. There should be background sounds (based on the mouseclick or a button to start) and then have sound effects for attacking and eating the food.  

This time you should have a "bad" food too which will decrease your health.

Specifics:

1. Add background music to your project.
2. Add a sound effect when eating the good food.
3. Add a sound effect when eating the bad food.
4. Upload all your files to your repository.
5. Turn in your repository link to Moodle.
