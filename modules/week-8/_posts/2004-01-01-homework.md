# Homework

In this homework, you are going to use the p5.play library and create a game.  You are welcome to rework your existing game or create a new one. I am open to either.

Specifics:

1. Use the p5.play library to create animations.
2. Move the player in different directions using different keys (WASD or arrow).
3. Display the immovable objects in random locations.
4. Prevent the player from walking through them.
5. Have collectible items.
6. If the player collects an item, increase their score.
7. Send all your files to your repository.
8. Turn in your repository link to Moodle.
